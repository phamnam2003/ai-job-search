# TopCV Search Skill

Search live job listings from **TopCV** (topcv.vn), Vietnam's largest-volume job
board. Pages are server-rendered HTML — no authentication, no API key, and **no
npm dependencies**. Fetching uses the system `curl` binary (TopCV's WAF blocks
Bun's native `fetch` by TLS fingerprint; curl is allowed), so it runs with just
`bun` + `curl` — both standard on Windows 10+, macOS, and Linux.

Best suited to the Vietnamese market across all sectors (TopCV is general-purpose,
not IT-only): filter by keyword (backend, golang, fullstack, react, …) and city
(`ha-noi`, `ho-chi-minh`, `da-nang`, and 60+ more provinces).

## Courtesy note

TopCV's `robots.txt` **allows** the search and job-detail paths (it only disallows
CV/account paths like `/xem-cv/`, `/viet-cv/`, `/private/`), so this does not
violate their rules. It is intended for **personal use** — TopCV is a large site
and may rate-limit, so keep request volume low and polite (no bulk scraping).

## When to use this skill

- Search job openings in a Vietnamese city by keyword/skill/role
- Scan the market for a technology (e.g. Golang in Ha Noi)
- Get the full description, requirements, and benefits of a specific TopCV job

## Commands

### Search job listings

```bash
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts search [--query "<kw>"] [--location <city>] [flags]
```

Key flags:
- `--query <text>` / `-q <text>` — keyword (title, skill, role). Multi-word input is hyphenated into the URL slug (`"backend developer"` → `backend-developer`). Defaults to `it` when omitted.
- `--location <city>` / `-l <city>` — city name/slug (`ha-noi`, `ho-chi-minh`, `da-nang`, …). Mapped to TopCV's server-side city filter (`-tai-<slug>-kl<id>`). An unknown value falls back to a client-side filter on the card's location text.
- `--jobage <days>` — **best-effort.** Max posting age in days, applied client-side by parsing each card's freshness text ("Đăng 2 tuần trước"). Weeks/months are approximated (×7 / ×30).
- `--page <n>` — page number (1-indexed).
- `--limit <n>` / `-n <n>` — cap total results emitted (client-side).
- `--format json|table|plain` — default `json`.

### Fetch full job detail

```bash
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts detail <id|url> [--format json|plain]
```

Pass the full job **URL** from a search result's `url` field (either the
`/viec-lam/…/<id>.html` or `/brand/…-j<id>.html` shape) — this is the reliable
input. A bare numeric **id** also works: it is reconstructed as
`/viec-lam/j/<id>.html` (TopCV resolves a job by its trailing id regardless of the
slug), but if that id no longer maps to a live posting the command returns a
`NEED_URL` error asking for the full URL. Returns description, requirements,
benefits, salary, location, and application deadline.

## Usage examples

```bash
# Backend roles in Ha Noi (quick scan)
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "backend" -l "ha-noi" --format table

# Golang roles in Ha Noi, top 10
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "golang" -l "ha-noi" --limit 10 --format table

# Fullstack roles in Ha Noi
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "fullstack" -l "ha-noi" --format table

# Page 2 of backend roles in Ho Chi Minh, as JSON
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "backend" -l "ho-chi-minh" --page 2 --format json

# Only jobs posted within ~7 days
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts search -q "backend" -l "ha-noi" --jobage 7 --format table

# Full details for one job (url from a search result)
bun run .agents/skills/topcv-search/cli/src/cli.ts detail https://www.topcv.vn/viec-lam/backend-developer/2231500.html --format plain
```

## Output formats

| Format | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| `json` | Default — programmatic use, passing the `url` to `detail` |
| `table` | Quick human-readable scanning |
| `plain` | Reading a single job's full detail (`detail` command) |

Search JSON shape: `{ "meta": { "count": <n>, "page": <n> }, "results": [ { id, title, company, companyUrl, location, date, salary, url } ] }`.
Missing values are `null` (never omitted). All errors are written to **stderr** as
`{ "error": "...", "code": "..." }` with exit code `1`.

## Notes

- **Location** filtering works only through the URL slug (`-tai-ha-noi-kl1`). The `?city_id=`/`?locations=` query params are silently ignored by TopCV, so the CLI maps `--location` to the slug form (68 provinces mapped, plus aliases: `hanoi`, `hcm`, `hcmc`, `tphcm`, `saigon`, `danang`). City ids verified live 2026-07: `ha-noi`=1, `ho-chi-minh`=2, `da-nang`=8.
- **`date`** is the card's *posted* freshness ("Đăng 2 tuần trước"), which varies per job — not the bulk-refresh "Cập nhật …" timestamp (mostly identical across a page).
- **Salary** is frequently `Thoả thuận` (negotiable) on TopCV; it is captured verbatim, and a numeric range ("20 - 30 triệu") is captured when shown.
- **Parsing** chunks each search page by the `.job-item-search-result` container so one malformed card cannot break the rest; each card is parsed independently. The job id comes from the `data-job-id` attribute and is cross-checked against the detail link.
- **`detail`** works for both job-URL shapes (identical markup) and reconstructs a bare id via the slug-agnostic `/viec-lam/j/<id>.html`.
